5. Query Optimizer ⚠️
6. Execution Helper ⚠️
7. Advanced Query Fixer ⚠️ (overlaps with #5)
8. Query Complexity Analyzer ⚠️ (overlaps with #6)

#### **After (Version 5): 6 Optimized Tools**
1. Clinical Term Mapper ✅
2. Query Analyzer ✅
3. Smart Schema Assistant ✅
4. Query Validator ✅
5. **🆕 Enhanced Query Optimizer** (merges #5 + #7)
6. **🆕 Enhanced Execution Helper** (merges #6 + #8)
