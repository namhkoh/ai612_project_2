## **üöÄ Specific Error Patterns to Address**

Based on failed query analysis, prioritize these patterns:

### **1. SQLite Syntax Issues (High Priority)**
```sql
-- Problem: EXTRACT function not supported
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM chartdate) = 2100

-- Solution: Auto-convert to STRFTIME
STRFTIME('%Y', chartdate) = '2100'
```

### **2. Complex Subquery Issues (High Priority)**
```sql
-- Problem: "near FROM" syntax errors
-- Solution: Restructure complex subqueries
```

### **3. Column Name Confusion (Medium Priority)**
```sql
-- Problem: procedures_icd.chartdate (doesn't exist)
-- Solution: Use admissions.admittime with proper join
```

### **4. Table Reference Issues (Medium Priority)**
```sql
-- Problem: icd9_code vs icd_code confusion
-- Solution: Auto-correct column names
```
