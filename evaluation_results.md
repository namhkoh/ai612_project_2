# AI612 Project 2 - Evaluation Results

## Clinical Term Mapper Implementation

### Implementation Summary
- **Tools Added**: Clinical Term Mapper (`clinical_term_mapper`) and Query Analyzer (`analyze_user_query`)
- **Purpose**: Map medical terms, abbreviations, and natural language to database representations
- **Target Problem**: Address the challenge of mapping clinical terminology variations in MIMIC-IV database

### Tool Features
1. **Clinical Term Mapper**:
   - Medical abbreviation expansion (e.g., "Hb" ‚Üí "hemoglobin")
   - Term standardization and variations
   - Database schema fuzzy matching
   - Confidence scoring for mappings

2. **Query Analyzer**:
   - Medical term extraction from user queries
   - Search pattern suggestions (SQL patterns, table names)
   - Related term discovery

### Evaluation Results

#### Final Performance
- **Date**: [Current evaluation]
- **Model**: gemini/gemini-2.0-flash
- **Agent Strategy**: tool-calling
- **Evaluation Mode**: valid
- **Trials**: 4

#### Metrics
- **Pass@4**: 90.0%
- **Pass^4**: 30.0%
- **üèÜ Final Score**: **60.0%**

#### Performance Analysis
- **Pass@4 (90.0%)**: Excellent success rate - 9 out of 10 tasks succeeded in at least one of the 4 trials
- **Pass^4 (30.0%)**: Lower consistency - only 3 out of 10 tasks succeeded in all 4 trials
- **Final Score (60.0%)**: Strong overall performance, indicating the tools significantly help with medical terminology mapping

### Key Improvements
The Clinical Term Mapper tools likely contributed to better performance by:
1. **Better Medical Term Recognition**: Correctly mapping abbreviations like "Hb", "WBC", "BP"
2. **Enhanced Query Understanding**: Helping the agent understand medical context
3. **Improved Database Navigation**: Suggesting relevant tables (labevents, prescriptions, etc.)
4. **Reduced Ambiguity**: Providing confidence scores for term mappings

### Technical Implementation
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into existing MIMIC-IV environment
- **Compatibility**: Follows existing tool patterns with Pydantic BaseModel
- **Medical Knowledge**: 60+ medical abbreviations and term variations
- **Database Integration**: Fuzzy matching against actual MIMIC-IV schema

### Files Modified/Added
- `src/envs/mimic_iv/tools/clinical_term_mapper.py` - Main implementation
- `src/envs/mimic_iv/env.py` - Updated to include new tools
- `test_clinical_mapper.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_integration.py` - Full integration tests
- `README_clinical_tools.md` - Documentation

### Next Steps
Potential improvements for even better performance:
- Expand medical knowledge base
- Add context-aware term disambiguation
- Integrate with medical ontologies (UMLS, SNOMED)
- Learn from successful query patterns
